### Notes
- Some `macos` commands needs to be executed with `sudo` internally, so it's recommended you have `sudo` privileges.
- The `trash` command will not work unless your terminal (e.g. `iTerm2`, `Terminal.app`) has the necessary permissions to access the Trash folder. You can grant this permission in `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Full Disk Access`.
