#  m-cli

:boom: **Swiss Army Knife for Mac OS X !**

## The difference

**m-cli** differs from other mac command line tools in that:

* Its main purpose is to manage administrative tasks and do it easier
* It doesn't install 3rd party tools because it doesn't have dependencies
* The installation is very easy and doesn't require intervention
* It only uses OS X commands


## Installation

To **install** or **update** m-cli you can run this command:

`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rgcr/m-cli/master/install.sh | sh`
